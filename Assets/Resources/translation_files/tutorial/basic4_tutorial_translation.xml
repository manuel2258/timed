            Huh now its starting to get interresting! The aspects of colors are pretty easy in this game. Effectors can 
            only effect Colliderbodys with the same color. There are special events to change the color of a Effector.
            So firstly try to get the Yellow Colliderbody into the goal, then change the Gravityfields color to Blue 
            and do the same with it aswell. Also note that the Goals color has to match the Colliderbodys color.
            Touch this field to finish the tutorial ...
