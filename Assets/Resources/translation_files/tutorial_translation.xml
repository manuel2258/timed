            This is the already mentioned ball, or rather ColliderBody.
            As you might have already noticed when playing around with the video player it is 
            effected by the normal gravity. However because of the flat ground the ColliderBody
            won't get anywhere near the goal.

            Thats where the so called Effectors will get handy. As the name might already tell
            they can effect the ColliderBodys that get into their range. When a ColliderBody
            is in their Range its core will get bigger indicating that it could interact 
            with the in Range ColliderBody.
            Pause the time, reset it with the Resetbutton, play it again and see how
            the Effectors core will get bigger. Afterwards touch this field to continue ...
