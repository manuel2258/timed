            Alright, that was enought about the UI for now.
            The games goal is to get the required amount of balls into the goal.
            The amount is different for every level and is marked by the number in its center.

            This is the already mentioned ball, or rather ColliderBody.
            As you might have already noticed when playing around with the video player it is 
            effected by the normal gravity. However because of the flat ground the ColliderBody
            won't get anywhere near the goal.

            Thats where the so called Effectors will get handy. As the name might already tell
            they can effect the ColliderBodys that get into their range. When a ColliderBody
            is in their Range its core will get bigger indicating that it could interact 
            with the in Range ColliderBody.
            Pause the time, reset it with the Resetbutton, play it again and see how
            the Effectors core will get bigger. Afterwards touch this field to continue ...

            You might ask yourself now why the Effector is not effecting the ColliderBody,
            although it is in range? Thats because the Effector is not turned on yet.
            Also you won't simply turn it on once, but rather define a timepoint at
            which it will be turned on automaticly. Click the Effector to continue ...

            Yeah those are a lot of possible things this effector could do, however the 
            available events are difference from level to level. For example in this level
            you can only define the On/Off Event. The available Events are listed bellow
            its name and pressing them will define the event at the current time. Which
            means that now whenever you will pass over this timemark the effector will turn
            on and pull all in range ColliderBody to its center. Reset the time again and
            define the On/Off Event at the 0s timemark to continue ...

            deselect the Event and therefor close the Editpanel. Clicking on another Event in the Eventpanel would

            You might think now that thats all nice and good, however won't get the ColliderBody into the goal either.
            Right now the ColliderBody is stuck inside the GravityField. While reading throught the Effectors information 
            you might have seen that the already defined Event not only turn the Effector on, but also off. So lets

            it to have the maxmimum amount of velocity it could have. Change its Executiontime to 2.3s and deselect
